# Ghat - GitHub Chat

This is the start of a project that aims to write a chat with GitHub integration. It should allow people to login with GitHub IDs, let people refer to issues, commits etc within chat.

It was intended to be a project for a customer but he didn't paid me so I've decided to transform it in this project.

If you have any idea please submit it as issue!!
